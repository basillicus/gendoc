Usage:
------
Just call the script as: 

    gendoc

    * In the folder has to exist a file with the paths to the images to be included in the document. Example: 

sec "Title of the section"
/home/david/calc/GaAs/tips/vasp/10_CollectionOfTips/60_DifferentBulkTerminations/31_DimerTerminated_MoreSaturated/10_As-As_dimer/TIP.jpg

    * Output: Generates a documentation.tex file and if compile_doc == True, will compile the document to generate also the .pdf file, including:
        - The images specified in the input_file 
        - The path to the file at the botom of each slide
        - Three blocks with:
            - The INCAR information
            - The OUTCAR information
                - Energy, num. of atoms, etc...
            - If the NOTEs file exist in the folder, will be included in the slide (one for every folder)

NOTE: Avoid blank lines in the file as it is not parsed correctly yet
    - The inputfile name so far has to be changed in the script itself. Currently is tip_files
    - The output file so far has to be chacnged in the script  itself also. Currently is documentation.tex

 TODO:
 -----
* parse_outcar (): Done!
* include_notes () Done!
    - Extract last modification date from the file
* Add -i and -o for input and output files option respectively
* Add option to choose the theme (-t )
    - Can be used like: Blue theme for finished results, orange theme for work in progress, for example.
* Add option to choose wether compile or not (-c )
* Add option to write a log file (similar info than the slides but in a text file, with no image)
* Fix problem parsing blank lines in input_file file

Idea about how to proceed: 
--------------------------

    * Locate all the OUTCARs in the folder to be documented:
      
        cd folder/where/all/my_calculations/are/
        find $(pwd)/ -name OUTCAR  > list_dir  # Note that paths have to be absolute

    * Execute the script create_images.sh to generate the images in the corresponding folder where the OUTCARs have been found 
        - Tune the create_images.sh script accordingly (IMAGE_NAME, etc)
        - It will use Jmol to create the images. One image in each folder
            - If the filename already exist, it won't generate a new image in that folder
            - Images can be generated by any means, but the script above helps

    * Once images has been generated, locate the paths to those images and store them as an input_file:

        find $(pwd) -name IMAGE_NAME  > input_file
            
            - This file will include the ABSOLUTE paths the the images to be included in the documentation.
            - Sections and subsections can be included by adding: 
                sec|section " Name of the section"
                ssec|subsection "Name of the subsections" 

    * When the input_file has been generated and edited accordingly (sec and subsect added) run: 
            
        gendoc
